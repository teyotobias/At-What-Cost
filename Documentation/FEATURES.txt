- RESTful API: Serves API routes for users, items, and orders.

HOW? 
HTTP Methods: Routes follow REST principles by using appropriate HTTP methods (POST for creating and logging in users, GET 
for checking token status)
Endpoint structure: Each endpoint is designed around a resource ('/api/users')
Stateless Communication: Use of JWT for authentication, maintaining stateless sessions.
JSON Responses: Returns data and tokens in JSON format.
